sg
============

Simple set of Graphics tools.

This is a Work in Progress.

## Requirements

`cmake` is used to compile the sources.

The default compiler used is `clang 9.0.0`.

The cmake files compile with `-std=c++17`.

There is a dependency with `libpng`.

## Install and Run the Example

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:massimo-marino/sg.git
$ cd sg
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./sg
```


## How to Use it

Start from the source code in `main.cpp` to see what can be done.
